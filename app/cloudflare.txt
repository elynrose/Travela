Now that we've set up the middleware, here are the steps you need to take to complete the Cloudflare setup:
Sign up for a Cloudflare account at https://www.cloudflare.com/
Add your domain to Cloudflare:
Click "Add a Site"
Enter your domain name
Select a plan (the Free plan is sufficient to start)
Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records
Update your domain's nameservers:
Cloudflare will provide you with two nameservers
Go to your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain)
Replace the existing nameservers with Cloudflare's nameservers
Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)
Configure Cloudflare settings:
SSL/TLS: Set to "Full" or "Full (Strict)"
Always Use HTTPS: Enable
Auto Minify: Enable for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Brotli: Enable
Early Hints: Enable
Security Level: Set to "Medium" or "High"
Bot Fight Mode: Enable
WAF (Web Application Firewall): Enable if available in your plan
Create Page Rules (optional but recommended):
Always Use HTTPS
Cache Level: Cache Everything
Browser Cache TTL: 4 hours
Edge Cache TTL: 4 hours
Enable Cloudflare's security features:
DDoS Protection
Rate Limiting
IP Access Rules
Firewall Rules
The middleware we've added will:
Trust Cloudflare's IP addresses
Properly handle real client IPs
Log Cloudflare headers for debugging
Ensure your application works correctly behind Cloudflare's proxy
Would you like me to help you with any specific Cloudflare configuration or explain any of these steps in more detail?


Let me modify the Cloudflare setup to better reflect this business model. We should focus on:
Protecting the payment processing
Ensuring secure user data handling
Protecting against content scraping
Maintaining fast page loads for itinerary browsing
Here's what I recommend for the Cloudflare configuration:
Security Settings:
SSL/TLS: Set to "Full (Strict)" to ensure secure payment processing
Security Level: Set to "High" to protect against common threats
Bot Fight Mode: Enable to prevent automated scraping of itineraries
WAF Rules: Add specific rules to protect the payment endpoints
Performance Settings:
Auto Minify: Enable for faster page loads
Brotli: Enable for better compression
Always Use HTTPS: Enable for secure browsing
Cache Level: Set to "Standard" for dynamic content
Browser Cache TTL: Set to 2 hours for itinerary content
Page Rules:
Apply to cloudflare.t...
HTTPS
Firewall Rules:
Block known bad IPs
Rate limit requests to payment endpoints
Protect against SQL injection attempts
Block suspicious user agents
